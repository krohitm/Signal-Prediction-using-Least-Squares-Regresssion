This is an implementation of least squares regression algorithm to predict next point in the time series.
* We use the training data to find parameters, validation data to validate those parameters, and the test data to evaluate how good of an approximation our algorithm gives us.
* The performance of the algorithm is measured in terms of Mean Square Error.
